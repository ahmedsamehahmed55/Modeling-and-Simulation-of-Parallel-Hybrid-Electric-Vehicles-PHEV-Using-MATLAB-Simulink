## Project Highlights

### Powertrain Modeling

Developed detailed simulation models for **conventional internal combustion**, **fully electric**, and **parallel hybrid powertrains** in MATLAB/Simulink. The drivetrain includes a **six-speed gearbox** and a **torque-coupling mechanism** to realistically represent power flow and vehicle dynamics.

### Control Strategy & Stateflow Implementation

Designed and implemented **Stateflow-based supervisory control algorithms** to manage:

* Regenerative braking
* Engine–motor mode switching
* Power split between the internal combustion engine and electric motor

These control strategies ensure **smooth power transitions** and **optimal energy recovery** during braking events.

### Performance & Efficiency Evaluation

Simulation results demonstrate an approximate **30% reduction in fuel consumption** for the parallel hybrid configuration compared to a conventional internal combustion vehicle, validating the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid architecture and control strategy.
